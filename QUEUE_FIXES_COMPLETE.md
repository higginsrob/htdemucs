# Queue Fixes & Enhancements - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Jobs Disappearing on Filter Click
**Problem**: Jobs would disappear when clicking filter buttons (All, Active, Queued, Completed)

**Root Cause**: Status values weren't being normalized to lowercase for comparison

**Solution**: 
- Added case-insensitive status comparison throughout
- Added null checks for job status
- Filter logic now properly matches job statuses

### 2. ✅ No Persistence
**Problem**: Jobs disappeared on page refresh

**Solution**: 
- Implemented localStorage persistence
- Jobs automatically saved on every change
- Jobs loaded from localStorage on page load
- Survives browser refresh and restart

### 3. ✅ No Clear History Button
**Problem**: No way to remove old completed jobs

**Solution**:
- Added 🗑️ Clear History button in queue header
- Confirmation dialog before clearing
- Keeps active jobs (queued/processing)
- Removes only completed/failed jobs

### 4. ✅ No Download All Feature
**Problem**: Had to download completed jobs one at a time

**Solution**:
- Added 📦 Download All button (appears when 2+ completed jobs)
- Downloads all completed jobs with small delay between each
- Confirmation dialog shows count
- Uses hidden iframes for multi-download

## New Features

### LocalStorage Persistence
```javascript
// Jobs are automatically saved:
- On job creation
- On status update
- On queue refresh
- On WebSocket updates

// Jobs are loaded on page load
- Loads from 'demucs_queue' key
- Merges with server updates
- Handles corrupted data gracefully
```

### Clear History Function
- **Button**: 🗑️ in queue header
- **Action**: Removes completed and failed jobs
- **Safety**: Confirmation dialog
- **Smart**: Keeps active (queued/processing) jobs

### Download All Function
- **Button**: 📦 in queue header (only shows when 2+ completed)
- **Action**: Downloads all completed jobs as separate ZIP files
- **UX**: 500ms delay between downloads
- **Safety**: Confirmation with count

### Improved Filtering
- **All**: Shows all jobs regardless of status
- **Active**: Shows only processing jobs
- **Queued**: Shows only queued jobs
- **Completed**: Shows only completed jobs
- **Works correctly**: Filters now properly match statuses

## UI Improvements

### Queue Header Actions
```
📋 Processing Queue    [📦 Download All] [🗑️ Clear] [🔄 Refresh]
```

### Button Hover Effects
- **🔄 Refresh**: Rotates on hover
- **📦 Download All**: Green highlight on hover
- **🗑️ Clear**: Red highlight on hover

### Smart Button Visibility
- **Download All**: Only visible when 2+ completed jobs exist
- **Tooltip**: Shows count "Download all X completed jobs"

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified

#### HTML (`/server/static/index.html`)
```html
<!-- Added button group in queue header -->
<div class="queue-actions">
    <button id="download-all-btn" title="Download all completed">
        <span>📦</span>
    </button>
    <button id="clear-history-btn" title="Clear history">
        <span>🗑️</span>
    </button>
    <button id="refresh-queue-btn" title="Refresh queue">
        <span>🔄</span>
    </button>
</div>
```

#### CSS (`/server/static/css/style.css`)
- Added `.queue-actions` styling
- Button hover effects for each action
- Color-coded hover states (green for download, red for clear)

#### JavaScript (`/server/static/js/app.js`)

**New Functions:**
- `loadQueueFromStorage()`: Load jobs from localStorage on init
- `saveQueueToStorage()`: Save jobs to localStorage
- `clearQueueStorage()`: Clear completed/failed jobs with confirmation
- `downloadAllCompleted()`: Download all completed jobs

**Modified Functions:**
- `initQueue()`: Now loads from localStorage first
- `refreshQueue()`: Saves to localStorage after update
- `updateQueueJob()`: Saves to localStorage on updates
- `renderQueue()`: Fixed filter logic with case-insensitive comparison
- `renderQueueItem()`: Safe status handling with defaults
- `updateQueueStats()`: Shows/hides download all button
- All job creation points: Now save to localStorage

## Data Storage

### LocalStorage Key
```javascript
'demucs_queue'
```

### Data Structure
```javascript
{
  "job-id-1": {
    job_id: "uuid",
    status: "completed", // queued, processing, completed, failed
    filename: "song.mp3",
    model: "htdemucs_ft",
    output_format: "mp3",
    stems: "all",
    progress: 100,
    created_at: "2025-10-26T..."
  },
  // ... more jobs
}
```

### Storage Limits
- LocalStorage typically ~5-10MB
- Can store thousands of job records
- Automatically handles corrupt data
- Falls back to empty if parse fails
