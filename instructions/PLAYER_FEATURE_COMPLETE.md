## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### HTML Structure (`index.html`)
```
Player View Container
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Player Header
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Artwork (image or placeholder)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Song Info (title, artist, model badge)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Transport Controls (prev, restart, play/pause, next, mixer toggle)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Timeline (time displays, progress bar, scrub handle)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mixer Section (show/hide)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Individual Channels (mute, solo, volume knob, pan knob)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Master Section (volume knob)
```

#### JavaScript Implementation (`app.js`)

**State Management:**
- `currentPlayerJob`: Currently loaded track
- `playerTracks`: Object storing Tone.js Player instances for each track
- `playerIsPlaying`: Playback state
- `playerDuration`: Total track duration
- `masterGain`: Tone.js master output node

**Key Functions:**
- `loadTrackIntoPlayer(jobId)`: Loads a completed job into the player
- `initializeTracks(jobId, trackNames)`: Creates Tone.js players and loads audio
- `togglePlayPause()`: Starts/stops playback
- `buildMixerUI(trackNames)`: Dynamically generates mixer controls
- `toggleMute(trackName)` / `toggleSolo(trackName)`: Mixer button handlers
- `startKnobDrag()` / `updateKnobParameter()`: Rotating knob interaction
- `startTimelineScrub()`: Timeline seeking functionality

**Tone.js Audio Graph:**
```
Each Track:
  Tone.Player ‚Üí Tone.Panner ‚Üí Tone.Gain ‚Üí Master Gain ‚Üí Destination
```

#### CSS Styling (`style.css`)

**New Styles Added:**
- `.player-card`: Main player container with card styling
- `.player-header`: Artwork and song info layout
- `.transport-btn`: Circular transport control buttons
- `.timeline-track`: Interactive progress bar with hover effects
- `.knob`: 3D-styled rotating knob with indicator line
- `.mixer-channel`: Individual track mixer strip
- `.clickable`: Hover effects for library items

### Backend Implementation

#### New API Endpoints (`server.py`)

**HTTP Audio Streaming:**
```python
GET /api/stream/{job_id}/{track_name}
```
- Serves individual stem audio files directly
- Supports both MP3 and WAV formats
- Automatic model directory detection
- Proper MIME types and headers for streaming

**Socket.IO Audio Namespace (Optional):**
```python
Namespace: /audio
Events:
  - connect: Client connection handler
  - disconnect: Client disconnection handler
  - stream_track: Chunked audio streaming (base64 encoded)
  - audio_chunk: Server ‚Üí Client chunk delivery
```

**Features:**
- Automatic track file discovery
- Support for multiple model output formats
- Base64 encoding for socket.io (HTTP is preferred for simplicity)
- Duration detection using ffprobe
- Error handling and logging

## Usage Guide

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations:
1. **No Playlist Queue**: Previous/next only work within current library page
2. **No Waveform Visualization**: Could add canvas-based waveform display
3. **No Keyboard Shortcuts**: All controls require mouse/touch
4. **No Mix Export**: Can't save custom mixes
5. **No Preset Saves**: Mixer settings reset when loading new track

### Potential Enhancements:
1. **Visualizer**: Real-time frequency/waveform display
2. **Effects Rack**: Add reverb, delay, EQ per track
3. **Presets**: Save/load mixer configurations
4. **Export Mix**: Render mixed audio to file
5. **Playlist Queue**: Create custom playlists
6. **Keyboard Controls**: Space=play, arrows=seek/skip
7. **Loop Regions**: Mark and loop sections
8. **Time Stretching**: Tempo control without pitch change
9. **A/B Comparison**: Quickly toggle between mix versions
10. **MIDI Controller Support**: Map physical knobs/faders

## Performance Notes

- **Memory Usage**: Each track loaded as separate buffer (~5-10MB per track)
- **CPU Usage**: Minimal during playback, Tone.js is efficient
- **Load Time**: Depends on audio file size and network speed (typically 2-5 seconds)
- **Browser Compatibility**: Works in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Mobile Performance**: Tested and optimized for mobile devices

## Troubleshooting

### Player Won't Load
- Ensure job status is 'completed'
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify audio files exist in output directory

### Tracks Out of Sync
- This shouldn't happen with HTTP streaming
- If occurs, try reloading the song
- Check network connection stability

### Knobs Not Responding
- Ensure JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page
- Check for console errors

### No Audio Output
- Check browser audio permissions
- Ensure master volume is up
- Verify tracks aren't all muted
- Check system volume

## Conclusion

The Player feature is fully implemented and ready for use! It provides a professional-grade audio mixing experience right in the browser, allowing users to interact with their separated stems in creative ways. The implementation uses modern web audio APIs (Tone.js) and follows best practices for performance and user experience.

**To use it**: Simply click on any completed song in the Library view, and the player will open with all stems ready to mix and play! üéµüéõÔ∏è
