# YouTube Video ID Fix - Complete âœ…

## Issue
YouTube video job folders were being saved with UUIDs instead of YouTube video IDs, preventing proper caching and deduplication.

## Root Cause
The playlist processing section in `server.py` was not updated during the refactor:
- Did not fetch metadata for each video (needed to get video ID)
- Did not pass `youtube_id` parameter to `create_job()`
- Did not pass `use_hash_as_id=True` flag
- Did not check for existing jobs (caching)
- Did not check video duration limits

## Fix Applied

### Backend Changes (`server/app/server.py`)

**Updated Playlist Processing:**
1. **Fetch metadata for each video** to get video ID and duration
2. **Check duration** and skip videos over 10 minutes
3. **Check for existing jobs** by YouTube video ID (caching)
4. **Pass `youtube_id` and `use_hash_as_id=True`** to create_job()
5. **Enhanced response** with statistics about cached/skipped/errored videos

**New Response Format:**
```json
{
  "type": "playlist",
  "playlist_id": "PLxxx",
  "total_videos": 10,
  "jobs_created": 7,
  "jobs_cached": 2,
  "videos_skipped": 1,
  "videos_errored": 0,
  "jobs": [
    {
      "job_id": "video_id_123",
      "title": "Song Title",
      "position": 1,
      "status": "queued",
      "cached": false
    },
    // ... more jobs
  ],
  "skipped": [
    {
      "title": "Long Video",
      "reason": "Video is too long (15:30)"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Added 9 videos (7 new, 2 cached)"
}
```

### Frontend Changes (`server/static/js/app.js`)

**Enhanced Playlist Handling:**
1. Store `cached` flag for each job
2. Display alert with playlist statistics:
   - Number of new videos added
   - Number of cached videos (already processed)
   - Number of skipped videos (too long)
3. Show cached message for single videos

**Enhanced File Upload Handling:**
1. Store `cached` flag for uploaded files
2. Display alert when file is already cached

## Verification

### Test Cases:
1. âœ… **Single YouTube video** â†’ Job folder named with video ID
2. âœ… **Same YouTube video twice** â†’ Returns cached result
3. âœ… **YouTube playlist** â†’ Each video folder named with video ID
4. âœ… **Same playlist twice** â†’ Cached videos are skipped
5. âœ… **Playlist with long videos** â†’ Long videos skipped, short videos processed
6. âœ… **Upload same file twice** â†’ Returns cached result (SHA hash)

### Expected Folder Structure:
```
./demucs/output/
â”œâ”€â”€ dQw4w9WgXcQ/              # YouTube video ID (single video)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stems/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ htdemucs_ft/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ Never Gonna Give You Up/
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ bass.mp3
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ drums.mp3
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ vocals.mp3
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ other.mp3
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ abc123def456/             # YouTube video ID (from playlist)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stems/
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ 9f4e8a7c2b1d...          # SHA-256 hash (uploaded file)
    â”œâ”€â”€ metadata.json
    â””â”€â”€ stems/
```

## Benefits

### 1. Proper Caching
- Videos are not re-downloaded if already processed
- Saves bandwidth and processing time
- Works across server restarts (persistent storage)

### 2. Easy Identification
- Job folder names match YouTube video IDs
- Easy to locate specific videos in file system
- Consistent with YouTube URL structure

### 3. Better User Feedback
- Users are notified when videos are cached
- Playlist statistics show new vs. cached videos
- Clear messaging for skipped videos (too long)

### 4. Enhanced Playlist Processing
- Duration checks prevent long videos from being queued
- Error handling for individual videos in playlist
- Detailed breakdown of playlist processing results

## Code Changes Summary

**Files Modified:**
- âœ… `server/app/server.py` - Fixed playlist processing, enhanced responses
- âœ… `server/static/js/app.js` - Added cached message handling

**Files Already Correct:**
- âœ… `server/app/services/job_manager.py` - create_job() logic was correct
- âœ… `server/app/services/youtube_service.py` - Metadata extraction was correct

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Start server in dev mode
make dev

# Test single video (will use video ID)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/youtube \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"}'

# Test playlist (will use video IDs for each video)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/youtube \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxxxxxx"}'

# Check output folder
ls -la ./demucs/output/
```

## Next Steps

The system now properly:
1. âœ… Uses YouTube video IDs as job IDs
2. âœ… Caches videos to avoid re-processing
3. âœ… Checks duration limits before downloading
4. âœ… Provides detailed feedback for playlists
5. âœ… Persists across server restarts

All YouTube processing functionality is now working as intended! ðŸŽ‰
